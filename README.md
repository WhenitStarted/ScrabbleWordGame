# ScrabbleWordGame

This is a project from the MIT Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python class. 

- In order to test out the program, you will need to download the main game file(the_game) and the words text file. 
- If you would like to see what each piece of code does or you want to try to build the program youself, you can read the "ps3" file.  
  - The test_ps3 file is used if you are building the program and need to test out if the specifc function works. There are further notes on that file.
- This game plays out like scrabble, you are given a certain amounts of random letters and have to build words. You are scored on the valid word and the letters in it. 

Thank you
